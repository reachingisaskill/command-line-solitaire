# Command Line Solitaire

## Intro
This was the very first program I wrote in C++. I love that I still have it lying around, I must 
have written it when I was 15 I think, with no help completely self-taught.
I think I've come a long way since then.

By the way. It doesn't work. I should probably fix it...


## Commands
Once its working again...

 * *deal* Deals the next card from the deck
 * *stack* *\<pile-number\>* move a card from that pile to the stacks at the top
 * *flip* *\<pile-number\>* reveal the top card of a pile if it is upside down
 * *move* *\<number-cards\>* *\<pile-number-1\>* *\<pile-number-2\>* move a number of cards from 
   one pile to another, other from the dealt pile.
 * *menu* options menu

## TODO
 * Develop a new version. Just so I can compare the old to the new and see how far my abilities
   have improved. Some rainy sunday maybe...
